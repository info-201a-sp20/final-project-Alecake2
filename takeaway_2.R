take_away_2  <- p("A major takeaway from this second visualization is that the
age groups 75-84 and 85 years and over have the highst COVID-19 death rates.
For example, for males, aged 75-84 there were 6801 deaths which was the highest
for males. For females aged 85 and over, there were 7927 deaths. So even though 
the exact age group which is most impacted  is different for males compared 
to females, it is clear that 75-84 and 85 and over are the two most impacted groups.
From this data, we can tell that in the future these age groups will be impacted
most by COVID-19. This also implies that on the other end, younger people are
at a much lower risk of receiving or dying of Covid-19.")
