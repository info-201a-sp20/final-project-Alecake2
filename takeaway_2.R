age groups 75-84 and 85 years and over have the highst COVID-19 death rates.
For example, for males, aged 75-84 there were 6801 deaths which was the highest
for males. For females aged 85 and over, there were 7927 deaths. From
this data, we can tell that in the future these age groups will be impacted
