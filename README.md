## Domain of Interest
### Why we are interested
Our domain of interest is the impact of COVID-19 in the US because it is relevant to our daily life at this moment. Given the abundance of available data related to the virus, we hope that we could generate a helpful data visualization that helps us to understand this threat better, so that to better protect ourselves.

### Data-Driven Projects Example
