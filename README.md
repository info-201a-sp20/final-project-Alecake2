## Domain of Interest
### Why we are interested
Our domain of interest is the impact of COVID-19 in the US because it is relevant to our daily life at this moment. Given the abundance of available data related to the virus, we hope that we could generate a helpful data visualization that helps us to understand this threat better, so that to better protect ourselves.

### Data-Driven Projects Example
#### 1. An interactive visualization of the exponential spread of COVID-19
This [project](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/) created by Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider has multiple illustrations that record the growth of COVID-19. Readers can change the axes and condition and see the growth trends updated daily.

#### 2.The Toughest Triage
This [project](https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ETHICS/oakpezqllvr/) created by Feilding Cage talks about when medical care is limited, who should be taken care first. He suggested some possible policies to help healthcare workers to better arrange limited treatment to most needed patients.

#### 3.How Long Will a Vaccine Really Take?
This [project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html) ceated by Stuart A. Thompson for New York Times Opinion gives estimation on the release day of coronavirus vaccine. His estimation is based on traditional viccine timelines, which can take decades.

### Data Driven Questions
#### 1. How does COVID-19 impact different age groups compared to other diseases?
#### 2. Are there any associations between the number of positive tests and gender and ethnicity?
#### 3. What is the difference in testing results across different states?


### How to answer our questions with the dataframe
We can identify how rapidly the COVID-19 spreads across states by comparing the number of testing that is positive relative to the total of testing conducted (positive, negative, pending). We can also compare the affected rate in different age  or gender groups and focus on college studentsâ€™ affecting rate.

### Datasets
